Echo-Globe is a web-based chat application that allows you to create and join chat rooms to exchange text messages, photos, videos, and files in real-time. Your privacy and security are our top priority, and we've designed Echo-Globe with the following user-friendly features:

- **No Personal Details Required:** Your privacy is respected! Echo-Globe doesn't ask for any personal information, such as phone number or email, so you can chat anonymously and securely.
  
- **Real-Time Communication:** Stay connected with friends and colleagues through seamless real-time messaging and file sharing.
  
- **No Message Storage:** Your messages and files are not stored anywhere. Once your chat session is over, the data is permanently deleted, ensuring your conversations are private.
